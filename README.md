# Small_Project
 Develop a console application to simulate basic banking operations. The program should utilize Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and best practices. Initially, the program's state will be managed entirely in memory. However, the design should be modular enough to later integrate with a database system, like MongoDB, to persist data.
